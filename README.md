# About vipa
At this point there is not much to say about vipa.
Basically, it should be a program that you can use to create a custom dashboard which is intended to monitor and visualize the contents of any database. But since vipa is currently more of a vague idea rather than a concrete plan, I simply can't tell more about it yet.

## Why bother?
`Why even bother? Aren't there plenty of tools already?`

Well, to be honest...I don't know. I had this Idea and thought it might be a fun project.
